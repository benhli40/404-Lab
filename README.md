# 🧪 404 Lab

> *Because “Page Not Found” deserves personality.*

**404 Lab** is a weird little web app that lets you generate beautifully broken 404 pages — then **copy the HTML/CSS** for your own use. It's part glitch art, part existential humor, and part dev tool.

Built with **Vanilla JS**, because frameworks shouldn’t be the only thing broken.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Random 404 generator** – Every click gives you a new layout, message, and theme.
- ⚡ **Themes** – Includes `Glitch`, `Neon`, and `Void` modes (with animations + effects).
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard** – Instantly grab clean, ready-to-paste HTML + CSS for your own site.
- 🎨 **Theme selector** – Pick your vibe or let chaos decide.
- 🧠 **Developer-focused** – No backend, no tracking, just local weirdness.
